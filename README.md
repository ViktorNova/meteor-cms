## meteor-cms

This package gives you a basic, out-of-the-box cms at `/admin/cms`.  We wanted
something to easily give your clients a way to maintain their own pages (think about pages) with an editor built into the application. We currently support markdown as the only way to edit pages. We envision a future where you can edit with a WYSIWYG and HTML, but that vision isn't a reality today.
